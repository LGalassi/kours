Kours is a web application made as the final project for CS50x 2020 that allows you to organize and manage all your courses.

## Main features

* Organize your courses by school;
* Customize the school's cards with emoji icons;
* Manage the courses of each school with a Kanban like board.

## Usage

After you create an account and log in you'll be redirected to the page where your schools are listed. To add a new school simply click on the card with the big "+" icon and fill the form on the "Add school" page. To delete a school and all the courses attached to it click on the trash can icon on the school's card. If you click on the school's card you'll be redirected to that school's courses page, where you can add new courses (added by default to the "TO DO" column) and move the existing courses through the other columns ("DOING" and "DONE") using the arrow icons. To delete a course click on the trash can icon on the course's line.
